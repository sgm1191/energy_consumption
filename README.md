# Energy consumption

This is a demo for forecasting energy consumption and demonstrate the power of machine learning models for forecasting. 

First an explanatory analysis is made upon the data of one of the cities. Then some models are trained to try to predict different lapses of time.

# Installation
For installation check `requirements.txt` file. You can install it whit pip as follows:
```bash
pip install -f requirements.txt
```

# Data
Dataset is taken from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption) kaggle competition there, structure of the data is explained as well as in the 
`ExplAn.py` file

# File structure

- `ExplAn.ipynb`: Data discovery analysis Jupyter notebook
- `ML_models.ipynb`: Maching learning models experimentation and results comparation.
